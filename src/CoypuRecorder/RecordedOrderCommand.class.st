"
I represent a message given to the performance recorder during a performance.
## For the Responsibility part:

I can print myself as a line of code in a String.
I have an order which represent the message used.
I can have an instance variable ""delay"" which is the number of seconds between the execution of the last command and me.

## For the Collaborators Part: 

Stored in an orderedCollection which is a variable of SavedPerformance.
Visited by a SavedPerformance.

## Public API and Key Messages

- print : print myself as a line of code.
- getPrint : visited by a SavedPerformance to get my print.
- getTime : visited by a SavedPerformance to get my time.

### Example of creation of an instance :
```
(RecordedOrderCommand new) order: 'freq: 138 bpm.';

```
